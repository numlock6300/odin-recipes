            A rich, sweet, creamy frozen food made from variously flavored 
           cream and milk products churned or stirred to a smooth consistency 
           during the freezing process and often containing gelatin, eggs,

            <strong>YIELD:</strong> About 1 1/2 pints
            <strong>TIME:</strong> 20 minutes plus several hours’ cooling, chilling and freezing
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>⅔ cup sugar</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a small pot, simmer heavy cream, milk, sugar and salt until 
                sugar completely dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat. 
                In a separate bowl, whisk yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk 
                about a third of the hot cream into the yolks, then whisk the yolk 
                mixture back into the pot with the cream. Return pot to medium-low 
                heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back 
                of a spoon (about 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer).
            </li>
            <li>
                Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room 
                temperature. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. Churn in 
                an ice cream machine according to manufacturers’ instructions. 
                Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer 
                until needed.
            </li>
        </ol>
