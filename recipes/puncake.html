        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A <em>pancake</em> is <strong>a thin, flat, circular piece of cooked batter made
           from milk, flour, and eggs.</strong> Pancakes are often rolled up or
           folded and eaten hot with a sweet or savoury filling inside. 
           In America, pancakes are usually eaten for breakfast, with butter
           and maple syrup.
